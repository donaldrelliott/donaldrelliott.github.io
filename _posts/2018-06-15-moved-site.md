Alright, so I decided to _**finally**_ move all of my stuff from GoDaddy hosting over to GitHub pages. At the base price for their service
I was looking at around $111 a year. That's the lowest tier they have. That's obviously not horrible for an email address, some hosting, and
a domain for a year, but I felt I could do better.  

My main complaint with them as a company was the atrocious load times my site would have randomly. I know I don't have tons of people flooding
my website, but since it generally consists of just basic content, there is no reason for it to take any length of time to load. After playing
around with GitHub pages for awhile I realized that load times were just faster all around. It was at this time that I decided to go ahead and start building something for my new _**free**_ host.  

Knowing I was going to lose my custom email by trashing my hosting plan I moved to
[GSuite](www.gsuite.google.com) for a whopping $5 a month. Not only do I get to keep using my custom domain email, but they also toss in **30GB** of free cloud storage, nice. This way if I need to host some large files to send to someone for downloading, I can still do that, without a dedicated hosting company.  

Anyways, that's all for now. I'll be posting updates randomly to this site in regards to software I'm working on or maybe something just in 
my daily life (like hiking or talking about watches). Until then, be safe, and enjoy your day.
