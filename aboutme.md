Hey guys, my name is Rod Elliott, and I'm a front end developer at Rocky Brands, Inc. The main brands I work with are Lehigh Outfitters, Lehigh Safety Shoes, SlipGrips, Shoe Angel, and CustomFit. I graduated from Oregon State University in March of 2018 with a BS in computer science. Before that I worked as a Senior Manager for seven years with GNC in my hometown after graduating from Marshall University in 2009 with a BA in history and psychology.  

When I'm not working on applications I'm staying busy with my day job, hiking the hills of West Virginia, and of course having fun raising my son with my wife.

My CV and other goodies. Also, stay tuned for a **Projects** page that will be set up in the near future.
